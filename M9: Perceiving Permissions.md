```

### Challenge 2: Groups and Files

```
hacker@permissions~groups-and-files:~$ id
uid=1000(hacker) gid=1000(hacker) groups=1000(hacker)
hacker@permissions~groups-and-files:~$ chgrp hacker /flag
hacker@permissions~groups-and-files:~$ cat /flag

### Challenge 5: Executable Files

```
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ chmod u+x /challenge/run
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ /challenge/run
Successful execution! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{EnPjrhCjyMHFfywPgAYyu87Aqi2.dJTM2QDL1IzN0czW}
